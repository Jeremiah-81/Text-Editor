# Text-Editor

This is a simple and easy to use text edditing application that anybody can use to post, comment, changes, store and print text.  This application can be used both online and offline.   

## Motivation

I created this text editor to help keep track of each post.  The information or different types of data on my projects.  It help's me do things like make changes to previous post's, store and even print out information helping me stay on track each day.  This is very useful if your like me and have many projects where you might spend each day working on something different.
